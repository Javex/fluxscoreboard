The Great FluxScoreboard
========================
The Great FluxScoreboard is a relict from times where scoreboards meant
something to people. It was mostly created by javex and later defiled by qll
(aka "The Unholy One"). It is written with a gazillion of libraries but the main
framework is based on Pyramid.
